In the shadows of the city, where the dim glow of streetlights barely reaches, lies a realm of forgotten fears. A place where the echoes of lost souls linger, trapped between the cracks of reality. Shadows dance with malevolent glee, whispering secrets of despair to those who dare to listen. The air is heavy with the scent of decay, and every step forward feels like a descent into madness. In this bleak landscape, hope is a fleeting illusion, and the darkness reigns supreme, devouring all who venture too close.
